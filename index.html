        i received a job offer mid-course,a,d the subjects i learned 
        were current, if not more so, in the company i joined.
        i honestly feel i got every penny's worth.

       "i was an EMT for many tears before i joined the bootcamp.i've been looking to make a 
       transition and have heard some pepole who had an amazing experience here. i signed up
       for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!i enrolled shortly thereafter.
       the next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life.since completing the
       course,i've successfully switched careers,working as a software Engineer at a VR startup."
