       "Before joining the bootcamp,I've <br>
       never written a line of code.I needed <br>
       some structure from professionals <br>
       who can gelp me learn programming <br>
       step by step.I was encouraged to <br>
       enroll by a former student of theirs <br>
       who can only say wonderful things <br>
       avout the program.The entire <br>
       curriculum and staff did not <br>
       disappoint.They were very hands-on <br>
       and I never had to wait long for <br>
       assistance.The agile team project,in <br>
       particular,was outstanding. it took <br>
       my learning to the next level in a way <br>
       that no tutorial could ever have.in <br>
       fact,I've lften referred to it during <br>
       interviews as an example of my <br>
       developent experience. it certainly <br>
       helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>
       developer after receiving multiple <br>
       offers, 100% recommend!"

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp <br>

        their experiences was easy.
